# CandleLightNet

CandleLightNet is a .NET library for accessing CandleLight-based devices. It uses C++/CLR to wrap the (candle_dll)[https://github.com/HubertD/candle_dll] in order to be accessible from .NET languages (eg C#). 

## License

As the original candle_dll is available under the LGPL V3, so is this library.
